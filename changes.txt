    * 'y' view model along y direction
    * 'z' view model along z direction
  * Improved reading and error reporting of SCONE scenarios

=== Fixes ===

==== SCONE 0.19.3 ALPHA ====
//Released December 6, 2018//

=== Fixes ===
  * When evaluating a scenario from sconecmd.exe, the average parameters are now used instead of the best, in order to be consistent with scenario test (Ctrl + T) from SCONE studio.

==== SCONE 0.19.2 ALPHA ====
//Released December 5, 2018//

=== Fixes ===
  * Fixed issue reading state_init_optimization.exclude from legacy scripts

//Released October 17, 2018//

=== New Features and Updates ===
  * MuscleReflex can now act with activation as source (using KA, A0 and allow_neg_A)
  * Reflexes can now use contralateral sources, using `_o` postfix.
  * Added initial_load and initial_load_dof to allow control over the initial position of the model
  
=== Fixes ===
