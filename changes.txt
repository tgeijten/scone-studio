====== What's new ======

==== SCONE 1.3.0 ====
//Released November 12, 2019//

=== New Features and Updates ===
  * SCONE scenarios are now loaded an visualized immediately after a file is opened or saved
  * Improved support for editing and optimizing more model properties (using ''Properties { ... }'') directly in the SCONE scenario. These include ContactGeometry (position, radius, etc.), Joint, and Coordinate properties. Closes #78
  * Major performance improvement of the SCONE User Interface when the 3D visualizer is not actively used
  * 3D viewer now supports keyboard shortcuts for orbit (''Left'', ''Right'', ''PgUp'', ''PgDn''), pan (''Shift + Arrow keys'') and zoom (''Up'' and ''Down'')
  * ''Ctrl + Space'' now toggles playback
  * ''Ctrl + E'' now evaluates the currently selected scenario
  * Visualizer no longer uses emissive component, added ambient_intensity parameter
  * SCONE Unit tests are now performed in parallel for improved performance

=== Fixes ===
  * When optimizing a scenario, the *copied* versions of models and scripts are now used, so you can freely edit the originals during an active optimization
  * Fixed incorrect "Please select a .scone file" error while optimizing or evaluating a scenario
  * ''PieceWiseLinear'' and ''PieceWiseConstant'' functions now check if ''dt > 0''
  * ''ImitationObjective'' was broken, now it works again

//Released September 13, 2019//

=== Fixes ===
  * ScriptMeasure / ScriptController: Fixed issue causing contact_force(), contact_moment() and contact_point() to return zero

  * Open File (''Ctrl + o'') now shows all supported file formats by default
  * Jumping tutorials now explicitly maximize results
  * Documentation fixes

  	* Added support store_data() for writing data to .sto and SCONE analysis window
  	* Improved error handling and reporting for scripts
  	* added body:point_pos and body:point_vel

  * Close current tab (Ctrl+W) now works correctly
  * Jump tutorials now use correct init_file

  * RangePenalty now supports 'mode' setting, allowing the final penalty to be the 'average' (default), 'lowest', or 'highest' of all recorded
  * New measure_type in EfforMeasure: SquaredMuscleStress. This minimizes the sum of (F/PCSA)^2 for all muscles.
  * Controllers now have 'name' member that is used as a prefix for all parameter names. This should prevent undesired parameter name clashes when combining controllers. CompositeController displays warning when child controllers have identical names.
  * Added warning in folder preferences dialog to avoid network drives (issue #53)
  * Documentation updates
  * Tutorial updates

=== Fixes ===
  * SequentialController now works correctly
